    "We often use probabilistic models to decide whether events that seem surprising are actually unlikely. The birthday problem is a classic example of such a phenomenon:  What is the probability that at least two people in a group of size `n` have the same birthday? Assuming that each year has 365 days (no leap years) and that each day is equally likely as a birthdate, __write a function which returns this probability as a function of the group size `n`__.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a hint, notice that enumerating all of the possible ways in which a group of individuals might share at least one birthday is quite challenging.  There could be one overlapping birthday, two overlapping birthdays, and so on. Instead, we'll calculate the probability that *no one* shares a birthday, and then subtract that value from 1.0."
