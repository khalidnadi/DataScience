These individual word probabilites will then be multiplied to etimate the probability of multiple word tokens appearing in a document given its polarity.

Previously we divided the word count by the sum of all the counts in the counter, which guaranteed that the sum of the probability of all word types was 1.0. Now that we are adding 1 to each word, what should the denominator be so that this new probability distribution will sum to 1.0?\n",
